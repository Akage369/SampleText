## SampleText
We are a group of 4 people who have decided to make a tribute to the japanese game Super Sokoban, launched in the 1992 for the SNES.

## Our first project, Super Soukoban
For the Project 1 subject we chose Super Soukoban as a game to replicate at the beginning of the course.

This is a japanese puzzle game about a man who has to work very hard and push boxes to earn money.
The player must push boxes around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a box into a position where it cannot be recovered.
Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.
The game can be very difficult because of 2 things you always have to keep in mind while playing. These are:

1. You have a maximum number of steps you can do per level.
2. You only can push boxes if they are in front of your character, so they can get blocked very easily if they touch a wall.

### The results:
Since we started this new project, we have learned a lot about how does a game work internally and we are very proud of the results we have obtained at the end.

Take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/M5DhaPk5DC4)! It sums up our project.
