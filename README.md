Super Soukoban: A man has to work hard and put the boxes on their right place to earn money, buy a new car and get the girl of his dreams. A puzzle game based on the steps taken to complete each level and not getting stuck.

Controls: 
-[SPACE]: to skip the presentation image/Pack-In-video logo/animated intro. Also, this key is used to execute the selected option in menus (title screen, level selection, pause menu, level completed, level failed) and skip the up-transition of the title in title screen.

-[W]: to move 1 position up in the game or more than 1 if you keep pressing. Also, this key is used in menus of title screen, level selection and pause menu to select the upper option and, in case of title screen and pause menu, if there is no more, go directly to the last one. 
You can keep pressing to activate the automatic movement of the pointer in that direction. 

-[A]: to move 1 position left in the game or more than 1 if you keep pressing. Also, this key is used in menus of level selection and level completed to select the left option and, if there is no more, go to the opposite side. 
You can keep pressing to activate the automatic movement of the pointer in that direction. 

-[S]: to move 1 position down in the game or more than 1 if you keep pressing. Also, this key is used in menus of title screen, level selection and pause menu to select the lower option and, in case of title screen and pause menu, if there is no more, go directly to the first one. 
You can keep pressing to activate the automatic movement of the pointer in that direction. 

-[D]: to move 1 position right in the game or more than 1 if you keep pressing. Also, this key is used in menus of level selectionand level completed to select the option of the right and, if there is no more, go directly to the opposite side. 
You can keep pressing to activate the automatic movement of the pointer in that direction. 

-[P]: to enable/disable the pause menu in the gameplay. 

-[O]: to enable/disable the Stage, Steps and Limit interface in the gameplay. Like in the original game, this interface will automatically appear when the player moves, but in case the player has to move in that area, the interface moves to the other side of the screen (This can be proved on the level 44).

-[G]: to enable/disable the god mode (the words "god mode" appear in the screen). This allows you to use some useful keys for debugging and prevents the player from losing the game if their steps exceed the limit of the level.

-[0]: if god mode is enabled, it reduces the player steps to 0.

-[F1]: if god mode is enabled, it shows and hides the collisions of the level.

-[F2]: if god mode is enabled, it makes the player automatically lose the level.

-[F3]: if god mode is enabled, it makes the player automatically win the level.

-[F4]: if god mode is enabled, it goes to the previous menu/level.

Have fun playing! :)
