Super Soukoban: A man has to work hard and put the boxes on their right place to earn money, buy a new car and get the girl of his dreams. Basicly a puzzle game based on the steps taken to complete each level.

The movement is based on WASD, the movement isn't automatic while pressing, the player has to press the movement buttons for each step. Press the space bar to transition between screens.

With F1 it is possible to see the colisions.

F2 used for game over condition, SPACE after F2 repeat level

F3 skip level

SPACE to skip presentation screen
